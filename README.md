# 🛒 E-Commerce Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **ETL pipeline** for analyzing e-commerce transaction data. The data pipeline extracts raw data from a CSV file, transforms it by cleaning and aggregating the data, and loads the results into insightful visualizations for business decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data for customer behavior and product performance. By utilizing Python, Pandas, and data visualization libraries, it processes and aggregates the data to gain insights into sales performance, customer purchasing patterns, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, normalizing column data, and managing duplicate rows.
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering to create meaningful columns such as total spend, frequency, and customer segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create compelling visualizations that highlight important business metrics.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/a9verma/dataengrepo.git
   
2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:

   python data_pipeline.py

📈 Results
Here are some key insights and visualizations generated from the data:

1. Revenue by Product
This visualization shows the total revenue for each product in the dataset.


2. Customer Segmentation by Spend
This plot displays the different customer segments based on their total spending over time.


3. Average Order Value by Customer
The average order value for each customer across different product categories.


📊 Data Pipeline Workflow
Extract: Raw data is loaded from a CSV file containing transaction details.

Transform: Data cleaning and manipulation is performed to handle missing values and to generate new calculated fields.

Load: The processed data is analyzed, and key results are visualized.
